## Overview

This project is a Network Testing Tool designed to provide a user-friendly interface for running various network security and analysis tools.
The tool integrates multiple security tools, such as Nmap, Wireshark (tshark), BetterCap, ARP Spoofing, and more, into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
It allows users to select and run specific tools, view real-time output, and detect potential threats in the network. 
## Key Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using Tkinter, the GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the tool.Users can input the target IP or domain, select tools, and start/stop scans or attacks.
- **Automatic Gateway IP Detection**: The tool automatically detects the default gateway IP address from the system, eliminating the need for manual input.
- **Tool Integration**: The tool integrates multiple network security tools like , Nmap,Burpsuite,Wireshark,BetterCap and more.
- **Threat Detection**: The tool dynamically updates the GUI to reflect the threat status (e.g., changes the background color to red if a threat is detected).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For a Module Called "Scapy".Its an Network Manupalation Tool in Python.
- **Python-tk**: For creating GUI and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Subprocess**: For running command-line tools (e.g., nmap, tshark, bettercap).
- **Threading**:  For running tools concurrently in separate threads.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the Automatic Gateway address Gathering. The solution involved using python tool called Netifaces.
## Outcome

It has been a good experience in devoloping this project and looking forward on exploring the future networking networks.
